# Support code for "Iteration of low-degree rational inner skew-products"

These Mathematica notebooks are computational supplements to our study of the dynamics of low-degree RISPS. 

examples.nb contains computations that produce the examples covered in the manuscript, as well as interesting extensions.

risps_from_graphs.nb contains a method for producing new RISPs from the Nevanlinna representation for analytic self-maps of the upper half plane in several variables. See Agler, Tully-Doyle, Young <https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.2261>, Pascoe<https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08707>, and Bickel, Pascoe, Sola<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04666> for more on Nevanlinna representations.
